            <h4>In this project, I gained experience in conducting user research, using quantitive and qualitative methods to better understand users. This would in turn, result in intuitive and effective designs. Following the brief, a single-feature app prototype was created, to improve one’s experience in combating the problem of poor posture.</h4>

            <h4>Initially, I documented my personal experience with the problem, using cognitive sketches to represent and how the areas in which I struggle with practising good posture. I recorded the context, as well as my goals, feelings and thoughts before, during and after this problem, in a diary study. Using these qualitative methods of obtaining and analysing user data, I sketched and developed design ideas for the interaction, interface and flow of my app prototype. A paper prototype followed a series of wire-flows, which was then tested on a participant in a test scenario. .</h4>

            <h4>I continued to further deepen my understanding of the user’s experience to improve on the design of my product. Gathering more participants, I conducted interviews with questionnaire design, to uncover other people’s experiences with poor posture. User data was distilled into written and visual reports of cognitive sketches and experience maps. With these new insights, I made iterations to improve my design. I also added UI patterns to address information needs users may have when completing the task of maintaining good posture. In Figma, I created a high-fidelity prototype from my improved wire flows. I ensured it contained all key state changes and interactions to express how the features will work.</h4>

            <h4>Ideas for the visual structure and aesthetic style of my product’s UI were developed with digital mockups. I explored different layouts before undergoing usability testing. These included the 5-second and 1st click tests. With 15 participants, I gained written and visual data, which were used to further improve my UI in the prototype. For my final UI design, I created a design system including rules for typography, colour, layout and UI components.

                Through this project, I have learnt about the importance of documenting the task and the various methods in gaining different insights. This way, we get a holistic understanding of the user’s experience, which informs our designs.</h4>
