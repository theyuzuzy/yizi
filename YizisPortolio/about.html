            <h2>
                I am a digital design student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                As someone who has grown up with art and technology, and worked in hospitality, I was excited when I was introduced to UX/UI. Not only were you able to create aesthetically pleasing visuals for digital products, these visuals would also play a part in addressing peopleâ€™s needs. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                With a passion for problem-solving and improving the user experience, I am eager to gain hands-on experience for UX/UI and Graphic Design, in a professional environment. 
            </h2>
            <h2>
                When I am not making art or designing, you can find me flexing my non-existent muscles in the gym.
