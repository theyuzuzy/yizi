                    <h3>
                        Journey to the Moon is an interactive installation that shares Chinatown’s history, under the theme of the Mid-Autumn Festival. With both an adult and children’s version, this mobile application (app) uses augmented reality (AR) to feature a 3 dimensional (3D) model of Chinatown.

                <h3>
                    To honour the cultural significance of Chinatown in Melbourne, we proposed an app that would showcase a 3D model of Chinatown, upon scanning a physical map via the camera. Information about the historical sites can be accessed through content cards. In the adult version, an itinerary would be generated based on the sites they are interested in. 
                    In the children’s version, there is a moon rabbit mascot, inspired by the Mid-Autumn Festival tale. It encourages children to explore Chinatown, so it can return home to the moon. An animation of the rabbit leaping onto the moon follows the completion of the exploration, as a reward for the children. 
            
                    We researched about the history and created three user personas, ranging from a primary school student, to a father and to a flight attendant. After all, regardless of age and background, everyone is able to enjoy a digital tour of Chinatown, learning about its historical sites in an engaging manner. 
                    We also created a user story for the flight attendant, to contextualise the use of our interactive.

                    We researched about competitors using AR in their apps, which include the technology company, 4experience and mobile game, Pokemon Go. We analysed how they used AR and how we can improve our features to make it unique. 

                    For our proposed approach, we created a flowchart for the app to prepare for the prototype. We started with wireframing the app in Figma, before establishing a style guide. 
                    We made the graphics and the animation in Procreate and Illustrator, for the mockup and final prototype. For the AR feature, we made the models in Blender, before using SparkAR to make the models appear through the camera lens.

                    Through the design process, we encountered challenges.
        
                    <li>
                    Everyone had a different understanding of the proposed approach for the project:
                    In response, I wrote the proposed approach onto our process documentation and Trello board. I held frequent team meetings to discuss the project’s proposed approach and keep track of everyone's process in their roles. When there was confusion surrounding the proposed approach, I encouraged everyone to share their understandings, and see what aspects differed from the other members. I would then be able to remind them of the approach we agreed on. 
                    However, there were times where we had to make reiterations to the proposed approach, to improve the technical implementation of the design. Thus, I encouraged everyone’s input, including them in the proposed approach, while ensuring it would not be overwhelming. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    Content tailored to Adult and Children’s Versions:
                    Since we were catering to personas of different ages and backgrounds with both an adult and children’s version, we needed to customise the information to suit the targeted demographics. In response, we simplified our information into dot points for the children’s version, so it would be easily understood.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    Animation:
                    I was responsible for the graphics, as well as the animation. As a designer specialising in UX/UI and graphic design, I had limited experience in animating. I studied the movements of rabbits and learnt about different types of frames, including keyframes, in-between frames and extreme frames, to create the animation successfully.

                <h3>
                    Presented with both Bui Vien Walking Street and Degraves Street inspired signs, users can choose to enter either laneway. They are encouraged to explore the panoramic views of the laneway, by moving around and clicking on objects. 
                    Each object represents one of the four categories: History, Transport, Food and Nightlife. Sounds significant to the laneway play on hover and information on a carousel of content cards appear on click. On the content cards are visual and textual information that are conveyed in a clear and concise manner. 
                    Users can also choose to explore the selected category in the other city, through these content cards.

                    We first conducted research on both cities, Melbourne and Ho Chi Minh City, focusing on what made them similar, yet unique, and the topic of ‘Cultural Tourism’. Stumbling across an article about Ho Chi Minh City laneways and how it paralleled those in Melbourne, written by <a href="https://regularsteven.com/streets-and-laneways-of-ho-chi-minh-city/" target="_blank">Steven Wright</a>, we were inspired to showcase the laneway cultures of both cities. 
                    We learnt more about the cultures, before proposing the idea of an interactive and visually engaging experience that introduces travellers to the two cities through its laneways. 
                    We analysed other similar websites as case studies, such as Elegant Seagulls, which used prompts and user interaction to unlock content. We created personas and scenarios, after making empathy maps and journey maps on Miro to better understand them. After gaining feedback, we iterated our proposal, before making user flow and site architecture for the wireframes on Adobe XD. We simultaneously worked on the mockups and prototypes on Figma, making graphics on Procreate and following design considerations.

                <h3>Through the design process, we encountered certain challenges.
                    <li>Type of media format for the visuals:
                    Initially, we proposed still-images presented through parallax scrolling. However, we gained feedback that this format limits the interactivity and creates a sense of division between the two cities. As we wanted to focus on the link between the two cities and their laneway cultures, where they are similar despite their differences, we came up with either 360 degree video or panoramic imagery.
                    We agreed on the latter, as it would prevent cognitive overload and overwhelm from too much movement in the footage.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    Setting the two laneways apart visually:
                    While we wanted to show similarities between the cities, users should also be able to distinguish between them. Therefore, we implemented light and dark modes. 
                    The content cards and the navigation bar in Bui Vien Walking Street will be presented in a dark mode, whereas Degraves Street is in light mode. 
                    Bui Vien Walking Street in dark mode also highlights its vibrant and bustling nightlife, which contrasts with Degraves Street in light mode, which showcases its rush hours and coffee runs in the morning.
                    </li>

                    <li>Aesthetic of the website’s imagery:
                        Initially, we wanted to present the graphics in a flat style, using Adobe Illustrator. However, the aesthetic did not match the detailed elements of the laneways. 
                        As a result, we changed to a semi-realistic style, using Procreate, that references the graffiti and street art present in both cities. 
                        This style was achieved in Procreate, as the iPad was able to capture the natural strokes, reminiscent of street art. The style is able to stand out to attract the attention of the users, and is supported by outlines that also suggest clickability.

                <h3>Through the design process, I faced challenges.
                    <li>Types of notifications: In my initial design of the app, there was only one type of notification, which was setting the days and one specific time that would remind users to practise posture. I gained feedback about it being limited in its ability to effectively remind users on correcting posture. Thus, I designed two types of notifications, where one repeats at set intervals and the other occurring at specific times. This challenged how I showcased them visually, so I experimented with various wordings and UI. 
                    The two notifications are confusing and thus, must use visuals, such as lines, to separate them.</li> 
                    <li>Colour palette: I tried to create a playful app, however the minimalistic colour scheme of greens and a contrasting hue of reddish-brown failed to present this feeling. Further, the reddish-brown was used on the page where the user gives up on practising posture. I realised it would discourage the user with this colour and thus, decided to change it. The colours have to be neutral, so there are no negative connotations.</li> 
                    <li>Design of Home Page: There is a ‘tap for more’ button on the middle left of the page. This is the result of my various attempts of showcasing what durations are suited for what types of people, such as 1 minute for busy people and 5 minutes for those who have more time. However, this button seems out of place and creates an imbalance in the visual hierarchy. As a result, I decided to move the short descriptions of the different durations into the interface when the timer starts.</li>

                <h3> As a form of activism, Paw & Footprints is a mobile application that aims to:
                    <li>Educate the user on the species that are at risk due to climate change</li>
                    <li>Mobilise the user to take small individual actions that creates collective impact</li>
                    <li>Engages the user with appealing and colourful illustrations of endangered and extinct species</li>
                    <li>Motivate users with a record of all the actions they have taken to support the environment</li>

                    Users can learn about species at risk due to climate change through multiple ways. When four daily tasks are completed, a specimen is unlocked at random and there is a ‘Learn More’ button that leads to a carousel of content cards. All contain an image and concise description of the species, and some provide sounds of the species. To reduce excessive actions, arrows on both sides of the carousel allow access to information about previously unlocked species. 
                    
                    Users are mobilised to take individual actions to create collective impact through the daily tasks, with 4 random location-based tasks. These tasks are environmentally conscious, and by making them relatively easy to complete and set at home, users can develop green habits.

                    Users are engaged with colourful illustrations of endangered and extinct species. On Procreate, I intentionally used a ‘charcoal’ brush to create textured designs, showing that not everything is perfect and polished. This ensures the persona, the university students, who are young, are not intimidated when using the app. The rough style also aligns with the purpose of the app, where despite the actions seeming small, a collective impact is achieved. 
                    
                    Users are motivated by a record of all the actions they have taken to support the environment in a creative and organised manner. To show information at a glance, I designed the interface to visually show what days had all four completed tasks, and what days had less than four. The paw design also references the name of the app, along with the focus on endangered and extinct species. The day that has been clicked on has shadow applied to it, which contrasts with the lowered opacities of the other days of the week.

                <h3>Through the design process, I encountered challenges.
                    <li>Design of icons: I wanted to customise the icons to fit the context of the app. Thus, instead of using standard icons, I tried to incorporate paws and footprints into my own designs. This led to many variations and experimentations, before I achieved designs that are unique, yet easy to see and understand at a glance.</li>
                    
                    <li>Design of the History Page: The History Page includes a record of the user’s completed tasks in the past. This comprises a lot of information, such as the exact day, date, daily overview, weekly overview and details about the tasks. I explored different layouts that would showcase all the information in one interface, as I wanted to avoid unnecessary clicks for the user. Ultimately, I was able to showcase the exact date at the top, weekly overview in the middle and fit the exact day, daily overview and details about the tasks at the bottom of the page. The visual design of the weekly overview was created with the intention of showing what species have been unlocked and how many tasks were completed each day.</li>
                    
                    <li>Sound design: Initially, the app did not have any sound effects. This however, diminished the user experience. Thus, I added sounds of species in the information content cards, which also achieves the purpose of the app. After all, users can understand more about the species, by listening to them as well. I also added a success sound effect whenever they unlock species, to create an audiovisual cue.</li>

                <h3>As the UX/UI Designer:
                    <li>I identified my personas, created their profiles and scenarios</li>
                    <li>I created an empathy map, journey map and user flow to prepare for my prototype process</li>
                    <li>I established the style guide and designed the visual elements, including the buttons, icons, animations and graphics on Procreate</li>
                    <li>I researched extensively into climate change, impacts on endangered species, and information about certain species that are featured in my mockups and prototype</li>
                    <li>I created low and high-fidelity wireframes, mockups and prototypes</li>
                    
                    As the Video Editor:
                    <li>I watched other app trailers to gain a better understanding of the video structure and flow</li>
                    <li>I created a storyboard for the app trailer</li>
                    <li>I created most visual elements of the video, such as screen recordings of the prototype in action, as well as text against coloured backgrounds</li>
                    <li>I sourced other visual elements, including screenshots of news articles about climate change and video footage of pollution on news sites and Pixabay</li>
                    <li>I sourced audio elements from Pixabay that were appropriate for the trailer, which work to create the transition between a sombre to hopeful feeling</li>
                    <li>I cut certain parts of the visual elements to match the beats of the audio at the start to spark viewer’s interest</li>
                    <li>I adjusted the volumes of the audio elements to create and maintain the emotional appeal</li>
