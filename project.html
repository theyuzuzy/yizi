                    <h2>Role: Project Manager & Graphic Designer</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Journey to the Moon is an interactive installation that conveys Chinatown’s history, with the theme of the Mid-Autumn Festival. With both an adult and children’s version, this mobile application (app) features augmented reality (AR) with a 3 dimensional (3D) model of Chinatown.

            <section id="section-3" class="section-3">
                <h3>To honour the cultural significance of Chinatown in Melbourne, we proposed an app that would showcase a 3D model of Chinatown, upon scanning a physical map via the camera. Information about the historical sites can be accessed. In the adult version, an itinerary would be generated based on the sites they are interested in. In the children’s version, there is a moon rabbit mascot, inspired by the Mid-Autumn Festival tale. They encourage children to explore Chinatown, to help them return back home on the moon. An animation of the rabbit on the moon follows the completion of the exploration. 
                    Regardless of age and background, all people are able to enjoy a digital tour of Chinatown, learning about its historical sites in an engaging manner.
            
                    We created three personas, ranging from a primary school student, to a father, and a flight attendant. For the flight attendance, we created a user story.
                    We researched about competitors using AR in their apps, which include the technology company, 4experience and mobile game, Pokemon Go. We assessed how they used AR and how we can improve our features to make it unique. 
                    For our proposed approach, we created a flowchart for the app, style guide, sketches for the graphics, before wireframing and prototyping.

                <h3>Through the design process, we encountered certain challenges. 
                    When brainstorming ideas, some team members’ understanding of the project would differ to others’. To solve this, I held team meetings, where I listened to everyone and wrote down the proposed approach that we would all agree on.
                    Since we were catering to personas of different ages and backgrounds with both an adult and children’s version, we needed to ensure the detail in information also varied. Thus, we had to simplify our information to make it more appealing for children in the children’s version.
                    Another challenge was the animation. As a designer specialising in UX/UI and graphic design, I had no experience in animating. To make the animation seem fluid, I studied the movements of rabbits and learnt about different types of frames, including keyframes, in-between frames and extreme frames.

                <h3>As the project manager, I was responsible for managing the production of the required deliverables. I planned and monitored the project, delegating roles and tasks to every team member. I encouraged input from everyone, listened attentively to every idea and ensured our workloads were fair and balanced. 
                    
                    As the Graphic Designer, I researched, sketched and followed the style guide for my designs. I explored, evaluated and showed the variations of my designs to my teammates, ensuring their feedback was incorporated in the reiteration process. These designs included the logo of the app, moon rabbit mascot, maps of Chinatown and loading bar. I also made the animation for the moon rabbit’s journey to the moon.
