                        To honour the cultural significance of Chinatown in Melbourne, we proposed an app that would showcase a 3D model of Chinatown, upon scanning a physical map via the camera.
                        <li>Information about the historical sites can be accessed through AR and within the app.</li>
                        <li>

                            <li>
                                I wrote the proposed approach into our documentations and Trello board, to make it accessible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Frequent team meetings to discuss the project’s proposed approach were also held.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If our understandings misligned, I would listen and see which aspects were different, and remind them of the approach we had agreed on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When we had to reiterate the proposed approach, to improve the design, I encouraged everyone’s input. I included the ideas in the proposed approach, while ensuring the proposal would not be overwhelming.

                            Catering to personas of different ages and backgrounds with both an adult and children’s version, we needed to customise the information to suit the different demographics. Thus, information was simplified into dot points for the children’s version.

                            I studied the movements of rabbits and learnt about different types of frames, including keyframes, in-between frames and extreme frames, to create the animation successfully.

                            <li>Instead of standard icons, I wanted to customise the icons, incorporating paws and footprints, to fit the context of the app.</li>
                            <li>This led to many variations and experimentations, before I achieved designs that are unique, yet easy to see and understand at a glance.</li>

                            <li> The History Page includes a record of the user’s completed tasks in the past. This comprises a lot of information, such as the exact day, date, daily overview, weekly overview and details about the tasks.</li>

                            <li>I sourced other visual elements, including screenshots of news articles about climate change and video footage of pollution on news sites and Pixabay</li>
                            <li>I sourced audio elements from Pixabay that were appropriate for the trailer, which work to create the transition between a sombre to hopeful feeling</li>
                            <li>I cut certain parts of the visual elements to match the beats of the audio at the start to spark viewer’s interest</li>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <h3>Types of notifications:</h3>
                       <ul>
                            <li>In my initial design of the app, there was only one type of notification, which was setting the days and one specific time that would remind users to practise posture. I gained feedback about it being limited in its ability to effectively remind users on correcting posture.</li>
                            <li>Thus, I designed two types of notifications, where one repeats at set intervals and the other occurring at specific times. This challenged how I showcased them visually, so I experimented with various wordings and UI.</li>
                            <li>The two notifications are confusing and thus, require lines, to separate them visually.</li> 
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Colour palette:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I tried to create a playful app, however the minimalistic colour scheme of greens and a contrasting hue of reddish-brown failed to present this feeling. Further, the reddish-brown was used on the page where the user gives up on practising posture. I realised it would discourage the user with this colour. I decided to change it and ensure there are no negative connotations.</li> 
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Design of Home Page:</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <li> There is a ‘tap for more’ button on the middle left of the page. This is the result of my various attempts of showcasing what durations are suited for what types of people, such as 1 minute for busy people and 5 minutes for those who have more time.</li>
                        <li>However, this button seems out of place and creates an imbalance in the visual hierarchy. As a result, I decided to move the short descriptions of the different durations into the interface when the timer starts.</li> 
                        </ul>

                        <li>I shared my personal experience and interviewed two people about their experiences, to create an experience map</li>
                        <li>I tested the prototype on 15 people, through 5 second and first click tests, and these results were used to improve the prototype</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I created wireflows, wireframes and conducted two rounds of prototype testing</li>
                        <li>I made iterations to the wireflows and wireframes based on the <a href="https://app.lyssna.com/tests/1a8a7d36cf43/results/3abc4ed4ea9a" target="_blank">feedback</a> and <a href="https://app.lyssna.com/tests/7df5bbd9a46e/results/b1a9c1396371" target="_blank">results</a></li>
                        <li>I made sure to include information needs and patterns</li>
                        <li>I created a design system, focusing on visual hierarchy, moodboard and aesthetic styles </li>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <h3>Type of media format for the visuals:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Initially, we proposed still-images presented through parallax scrolling. However, we gained feedback that this format limits the interactivity and creates a sense of division between the two cities.</li>
                            <li>As we wanted to focus on the link between the two cities and their laneway cultures, where they are similar despite their differences, we came up with either 360 degree video or panoramic imagery.</li>
                            <li>We agreed on the latter, as it would prevent cognitive overload and overwhelm from too much movement in the footage.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <h3>Setting the two laneways apart visually:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            While we wanted to show similarities between the cities, users should also be able to distinguish between them. Therefore, we implemented light and dark modes.</li> 
                           <li>
                           The content cards and the navigation bar in Bui Vien Walking Street will be presented in a dark mode, whereas Degraves Street is in light mode. </li>
                           <li>
                            Bui Vien Walking Street in dark mode also highlights its vibrant and bustling nightlife, which contrasts with Degraves Street in light mode, which showcases its rush hours and coffee runs in the morning.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <h3>Aesthetic of the website’s imagery:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Initially, we wanted to present the graphics in a flat style, using Adobe Illustrator. However, the aesthetic did not match the detailed elements of the laneways.</li>

                            <li>As a result, we changed to a semi-realistic style, using Procreate, that references the graffiti and street art present in both cities.</li>
                            
                            <li>This style was achieved in Procreate, as the iPad was able to capture the natural strokes, reminiscent of street art. The style is able to stand out to attract the attention of the users, and is supported by outlines that also suggest clickability.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I researched about the laneways and the cultures in Ho Chi Minh City and Melbourne to make initial sketches</li>

                            <li>I ensured everyone had the same understanding of the project, that we had fair and balanced workloads, and presented alongside each other</li>
                            <li>I strove to research in depth about the two cultures for the proposal and the information used for the content cards, analyse case studies thoroughly, create the early wireframes, help establish the style guide, plan the site layout and make design considerations to promote accessibility</li>
